# Roni-home-app

Welcome to the roni-home-app repository! 
This project was created as a way for me to practice and showcase my skills in React, TypeScript, JavaScript(ES6), and more. 
The app serves as a management tool for the home, uses Ant Design for styling, React-Router for app navigation, 
a REST API client for connecting to the database and external API's such as OpenWeatherMap. 
I hope you find the code informative and useful. Thank you for visiting!
